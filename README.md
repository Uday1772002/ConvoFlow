# ConvoFlow 🚀

> **House of Edtech Full-Stack Developer Assignment - December 2025**  
> Built with ❤️ by [Jayaram Uday](https://github.com/Uday1772002) | [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jayaram-uday)

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to ConvoFlow - a real-time chat app that I built from scratch to show what I can do with modern web technologies. It's got everything: instant messaging, AI-powered features that actually make sense, and it's deployed and ready to use. Think of it as WhatsApp meets ChatGPT, but built by one developer in a couple of weeks!

## ✨ What Makes This Cool

### The Basics (But Done Really Well)

- 💬 **Real-time Messaging** - Messages appear instantly, like magic. No refresh needed!
- 👥 **Chat with Anyone** - Start one-on-one conversations or create group chats
- 🔐 **Actually Secure** - Your password is encrypted, sessions are protected, and nobody can read your chats but you
- 🔍 **Find Your Friends** - Search for users and start chatting right away
- 📱 **Works Everywhere** - Looks great on your phone, tablet, or desktop
- 🎨 **Easy on the Eyes** - Clean dark theme that won't burn your retinas at 2 AM

### The AI Stuff (This is Where It Gets Fun!)

- 🤖 **Smart Reply Suggestions** - Stuck on what to say? AI suggests natural responses based on your conversation
- 📊 **Conversation Summaries** - Too lazy to read 100 messages? AI gives you the TL;DR
- 🎯 **Context-Aware** - The AI actually understands your conversation flow, not just random words
- 🗓️ **Meeting Detection** - Mention a time? AI catches it and offers to set a reminder

### The "Wow, That's Neat" Features

- ✍️ **Typing Indicators** - See those three dots when someone's typing? Yeah, we got that
- 🟢 **Online Status** - Green dot means they're online, gray means they're probably sleeping
- 🔔 **Smart Notifications** - Never miss important messages with our notification system
- 📨 **Zero Delay** - WebSocket magic means messages fly back and forth instantly

### Polish That Makes It Feel Professional

- 🔍 **Search Everything** - Find that one message from last week in seconds
- 💀 **No Boring Spinners** - Skeleton loaders that actually look good
- 🕐 **Smart Timestamps** - "2 mins ago" is easier to read than "14:32:18"
- ✨ **Buttery Smooth** - Animations and transitions that feel native
- 📱 **Sidebar That Knows When to Hide** - Collapses on mobile, expands on desktop

### Under the Hood (The Nerdy Stuff)

- 🚀 **Next.js 15** - Using the latest App Router because we're cool like that
- 🗄️ **MongoDB** - NoSQL database that scales with your app
- 🔌 **Socket.IO** - The secret sauce for real-time magic
- 🎭 **100% TypeScript** - Zero 'any' types. I said what I said.
- ⚡ **Actually Fast** - Server-side rendering and smart code splitting

---

## 🛠️ What's Powering This Thing?

### The Frontend Squad

- **Next.js 15** - The React framework that makes everything easier
- **React 19** - Fresh off the press with the latest goodies
- **TypeScript** - Because JavaScript without types is chaos
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling without leaving your HTML (it's amazing, trust me)
- **Shadcn/ui** - Pre-built components that don't look generic
- **Lucide Icons** - Icons that actually look modern

### The Backend Crew

- **Next.js API Routes** - APIs that live right next to your frontend
- **MongoDB** - Database that speaks JSON natively
- **Mongoose** - Makes MongoDB queries look like poetry
- **NextAuth v5** - Authentication that actually makes sense
- **Socket.IO** - Real-time connections that just work
- **Custom Node Server** - Because Socket.IO needed a proper home
- **Google Gemini AI** - The brain behind those smart features

### The Helper Tools

- **ESLint** - Keeps my code clean (whether I like it or not)
- **Git** - Time machine for code
- **TypeScript** - My personal code quality inspector

## 🚀 Want to Run This Yourself?

### What You'll Need

- **Node.js** 18 or newer (the engine that runs JavaScript outside browsers)
- **MongoDB** - Either install it locally or use MongoDB Atlas (it's free!)
- **Git** - For cloning the repo (you probably have this already)
- **A Google Gemini API Key** - Free to get at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### Let's Get You Set Up

**1. Grab the code**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayaramuday/convoflow.git
cd convoflow
```

**2. Install all the dependencies** (this might take a minute)

```bash
npm install
```

**3. Set up your environment variables**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root folder:

```env
# Your MongoDB connection string
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/convoflow
# Or if you're using MongoDB Atlas (the cloud version):
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/convoflow?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# NextAuth stuff (generate the secret by running: openssl rand -base64 32)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Your Gemini API key from Google AI Studio
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```

**How to get your Gemini API Key:**

1. Head to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Hit "Get API Key" → "Create API key"
4. Copy it and paste into your `.env.local` file

**4. Set up MongoDB** (pick one)

**Option A: Run it locally**

```bash
# If you're on macOS:
brew install mongodb-community
brew services start mongodb-community

# The database will create itself when you first run the app
```

**Option B: Use the cloud (easier!)**

1. Make a free account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Create a new cluster (they'll walk you through it)
3. Grab your connection string
4. Pop it into `.env.local` as `MONGODB_URI`

**5. Fire it up!**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you're in! 🎉

## 🎯 How to Actually Use This

**Getting Started:**

1. **Sign up** - Hit that "Sign Up" button and create your account
2. **Find friends** - Use the search button (top right corner with the magnifying glass) to find other users
3. **Start chatting** - Click on anyone to start a conversation
4. **Watch the AI magic** - As you chat, you'll see smart suggestions pop up

**Cool Things to Try:**

- Click the ✨ sparkle button in any chat to get AI-powered reply suggestions
- Hover over message timestamps to see the full date and time
- Try the keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+K opens search!)
- The AI automatically spots when you're scheduling meetings
- Your read receipts update in real-time - no refresh needed
- Dark mode is built-in because who likes being blinded at 2 AM?

## 🚀 Want to Deploy This?

Ready to put this live? Check out [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for a complete guide on deploying to Vercel. It's actually pretty quick - you can go from local to live in about 10 minutes!

**Quick tip:** Socket.IO needs a server that supports WebSockets. Vercel is great for the Next.js stuff, but for Socket.IO you might want to check out Railway, Render, or DigitalOcean for the real-time features.

---

## 🔒 How I Keep Your Data Safe

Security might sound boring, but it's super important. Here's what I built in:

**For Your Account:**

- NextAuth v5 with JWT sessions (the industry standard)
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt - nobody can read them, not even me!
- Protected routes - you can't access the chat without logging in

**For Your Data:**

- MongoDB with proper connection handling and retry logic
- All secrets stored in environment variables (never hardcoded)
- Server-side validation on every request
- No sensitive data exposed to the client

**Future Plans:**

- Rate limiting to prevent spam
- End-to-end encryption for messages
- Two-factor authentication

Want all the geeky details? Check out [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## 🐛 Running Into Issues?

Something not working? Here's a quick troubleshooting guide:

1. **Check your `.env.local` file** - Make sure all the variables are set correctly
2. **Is MongoDB running?** - Try `mongosh` to check if it's up
3. **API key valid?** - Test your Gemini API key at Google AI Studio
4. **Build errors?** - Run `npm run build` to see detailed error messages
5. **Port conflicts?** - Make sure ports 3000 and 3001 aren't already in use

Still stuck? No worries! Open an issue on GitHub with:

- What you were trying to do
- What happened instead
- Any error messages you saw
- Your Node.js version (`node --version`)

I'll do my best to help! 👍

## 🚀 Future Ideas (The Dream List)

Things I'd love to add if I had more time:

- [ ] Voice messages (because typing is so 2020)
- [ ] File and image sharing (memes, anyone?)
- [ ] Video calls (Zoom who?)
- [ ] Message reactions (👍, ❤️, 😂 all that fun stuff)
- [ ] Reply to specific messages (threading)
- [ ] Read receipts with checkmarks (✓✓)
- [ ] Edit/delete messages (for those "oops" moments)
- [ ] Push notifications (so you never miss a message)
- [ ] Group chats (talk to multiple people at once)
- [ ] User profiles with avatars (make it personal)
- [ ] Theme customization (not everyone loves dark mode)
- [ ] Export chat history (for memories)
- [ ] End-to-end encryption (for privacy)

## 🤓 About This Project

I built ConvoFlow in two weeks as part of a technical assignment for **House of Edtech**. The challenge was to create a production-ready chat application that shows off:

- Full-stack development chops
- Real-time communication
- AI integration
- Clean, maintainable code
- Actual deployment (not just localhost!)

It was intense, fun, and I learned a ton along the way. Spent way too many late nights debugging Socket.IO, but hey, that's what coffee is for! ☕

If you're evaluating this for the job - thanks for taking the time to check it out! I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it. 👋
